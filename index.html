				<h2>As First Reformed Baptist Church we believe:</h2>
				<p>The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are fully inspired, inerrant, and serve as the supreme authority for faith and life. There is one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, and is both true God and true man.

					Human beings were created in the image of God but sinned, incurring both physical and spiritual death, resulting in a sinful nature and guilt before God. Jesus died as a substitutionary sacrifice for our sins, and all who believe in Him are justified through His shed blood.

					We believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus, His ascension into heaven, and His ongoing role as our High Priest and Advocate. Additionally, we affirm the personal and imminent return of Jesus Christ.
					All who receive Jesus by faith are born again of the Holy Spirit and become children of God. There will be a bodily resurrection of both the just and the unjust, leading to eternal blessedness for the redeemed and eternal damnation for those who reject salvation.</p>
